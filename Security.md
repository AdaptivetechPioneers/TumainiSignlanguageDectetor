## Security

The Tumaini Flutter app incorporates several measures to ensure secure user interaction and data protection.

1. **Authentication**:
   - Use of secure Firebase authentication methods to verify user identity and access.
   - Implementation of two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security.

2. **Data Encryption**:
   - End-to-end encryption applied to all sensitive data exchanges between the client and server.
   - Local data encryption for any stored user data, making unauthorized access difficult.

3. **Permissions**:
   - Limited permissions for sensitive information (e.g., camera, storage) requested only when necessary.
   - Transparent user consent for permissions, following best privacy practices.

4. **API Security**:
   - All API requests use HTTPS, with OAuth 2.0 authorization for secured access to the server.
   - Regular API endpoint checks to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate security vulnerabilities.

5. **Security Updates**:
   - Regular updates and security patches applied to third-party libraries and dependencies.
   - Continuous monitoring for vulnerabilities to address issues proactively.

6. **User Data Privacy**:
   - User data is handled with strict privacy policies in place.
   - All data storage complies with GDPR and other data protection regulations.
